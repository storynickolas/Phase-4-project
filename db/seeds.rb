# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

10.times do
 
  # Review.create(review: Faker::Creature::Animal.name)
end

# Beer.create(name: Faker::Creature::Animal.name, abv: Faker::Beer.alcohol, beer_style_id: 1)
# Brewery.create(name: (Faker::Creature::Animal.name + ' ' Faker::Creature::Animal.name) )
